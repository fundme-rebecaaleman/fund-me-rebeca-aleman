				<h1>About me</h1>
				<div class="scroll-div">
					<p class="light-text">Greetings, my name is Rebeca Alem√°n and I would like to tell you the reason why I am making this fundraiser. I am 26 years old, Nicaraguan and for reasons of life, I have lived alone since I was 17 years old, I studied graphic design but due to the socio-political problem in my country, I have not been able to find a stable job and that is why I currently work independently. I was born with some problems of genetic malformations mainly in the bones of my face (jaw) but also in my legs (I will attach some medical documents) The pain became so intense that it prevented me from studying and working for a while, so i looked in hospitals in managua to support me to treat me, they had to remove the 4 wisdom teeth that had not even been grow, after so much effort and waiting, finally in 2017 they performed 3 surgeries on me although unfortunately it left me with sequelae on my tongue since a nerve was damaged and I lost feeling in my tongue permanently.</p>
					<p class="light-text">My dream is to be able to obtain my professional degree since due to having to be in medical interventions and due to problems in the country in 2018, I did not manage to finish my last class, but I also want to get out of this problem with my jaw since this has led me to trigger functional and aesthetic problems.</p>
					<p class="light-text">Despite not having the support of close people, with efforts I was able to start in 2019 with a medical team specialized in my case, starting with a treatment called <em>"neuromuscular deprogramming"</em> where I use a splint in my mouth with the aim of reducing pain. and correct the mandibular position, this process that was expected to be completed in three months, has taken 3 years of struggle.</p>
					<p class="light-text">Despite not having the support of close people, with efforts I was able to start in 2019 with a medical team specialized in my case, starting with a treatment called "neuromuscular deprogramming" where I use a splint in my mouth with the aim of reducing pain. and correct the mandibular position, this process that was expected to be completed in three months, has taken 3 years of struggle.</p>
					<p class="light-text">Currently my bite has changed and the pain has been relieved, however this is only the first part, the next thing now is the intervention of an orthodontist and an <em>orthognathic surgeon</em> which is out of my hands financially.</p>
					<p class="light-text">They informed me that my case, apart from being very complex, is very delicate due to the condition of my joint, due to the time that I was without treatment, it has worn out too much. Alternatives were sought to avoid orthognathic surgery and one of them is to inject Hyaluronic acid into my jaw joint to protect it and the use of mini plates to rotate my jaw, but recent studies have indicated that my case has been complicated due to that there are other problems that were discovered.</p>
					<p class="light-text">I must perform hyaluronic acid infiltrations, orthodontics and <em>mini plates</em> as soon as possible, a process that will take approximately one year, after all this I will be reassessed to know if another surgical intervention is necessary.</p>
					<p class="light-text">I have to raise approximately $6,000 for all the treatment that is still in process and your help, no matter the amount, would represent a great advance for me because this way I would be closer to putting an end to this fight, getting healed, and being able to stand out in my career and have a better future.</p>
